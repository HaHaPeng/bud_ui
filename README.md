# BUD_UI

Custom Component Library

Based On The React

# Instruction

You need to creat the React project before you can use BUD_UI.

Each folder in the root directory is a specific custom component.

## Use Component

*Example “Video_Component”*

You need to open the video_component folder and read the README.md file.

Find the dependencies and add them to your project dependencies.
```
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "antd": "^3.5.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.11",
    "video.js": "^7.10.2",
    "videojs-contrib-hls": "^5.15.0",
    "axios": "^0.21.1"
  }
```
then
```
    yarn  or  npm install
```
finally start your project
```
    yarn dev or npm run dev
```

### Remind

Component-specific functionality: You need to read the README.md file in each custom component.
